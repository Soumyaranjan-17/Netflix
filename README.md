# NETFLIX 

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Netflix website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the user interface and some key features of the original Netflix website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the web pages.

- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface and ensuring a visually appealing design.

- **JavaScript**: For handling interactivity, API requests (if integrated), and dynamic content rendering.

- **Fonts and Icons**:

   - Google Fonts (Poppins)

   - Remixicon

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Header Section**: Includes the Netflix logo, language dropdown, and a "Sign in" button.

- **Hero Section**: Displays a banner with main text, a small font text, and an email subscription form.

- **Trending Now Section**: A carousel of trending movies/TV shows (though in this static version, it does not have dynamic carousel functionality).

- **More Reasons to Join Section**: Highlights various benefits of joining Netflix, such as watching on different devices, downloading shows, and creating kids' profiles.

- **Frequently Asked Questions Section**: Includes accordion-style FAQs with detailed answers.

- **Footer Section**: Contains links to various help sections, legal notices, and contact information.
